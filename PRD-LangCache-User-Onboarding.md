# Product Requirements Document: LangCache User Onboarding Experience

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
This PRD defines the user onboarding experience for Redis LangCache, focusing on the critical decision point of how users create their first cache service after account activation. The document presents two distinct UX approaches and provides a recommendation based on user empowerment and intentional service creation.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current user onboarding flows often prioritize speed over user understanding and control. This can lead to:
- Users creating services without understanding configuration options
- Missed opportunities for users to customize their setup
- Reduced user engagement with advanced features
- Lower long-term retention due to suboptimal initial configurations

### 1.3 Proposed Solution
Implement a dual-path onboarding approach that allows users to choose between:
- **Option 1**: Landing Page + One-Click Creation (Recommended)
- **Option 2**: Auto-Create LangCache (Current approach)

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
- Increase user engagement with LangCache configuration options
- Improve long-term user retention through better initial setup
- Reduce support tickets related to service misconfiguration
- Enhance user understanding of LangCache capabilities

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in users who explore configuration options
- **Feature Adoption**: 25% increase in custom configuration usage
- **User Satisfaction**: 15% improvement in onboarding satisfaction scores
- **Support Reduction**: 20% decrease in configuration-related support tickets

### 2.3 Business Impact
- Higher user lifetime value through better feature adoption
- Reduced support costs
- Improved product stickiness
- Enhanced competitive differentiation

## 3. User Personas & Journey

### 3.1 Primary Personas

#### Developer Dave
- **Role**: Full-stack developer
- **Experience**: Intermediate Redis knowledge
- **Goals**: Quick setup but wants control over configuration
- **Pain Points**: Frustrated by overly simplified flows that hide options

#### Architect Alice

### 3.2 User Journey Mapping

#### Current State (Option 2)
```
Marketing Page → Form → Email/SSO → Auto-Create → Service Ready
```
**Issues**: No user choice, potential misconfiguration, missed learning opportunities

#### Proposed State (Option 1)
```
Marketing Page → Form → Email/SSO → Dashboard → User Choice → Configured Service
